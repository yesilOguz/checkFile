# checkFile
This SQL-based api application checks whether there is a virus according to the md5 of the files. All virus hashes are taken from [virusshare](https://virusshare.com/hashes). In order to use the application, a user must first be created and a token is obtained using the information of the created user. md5 control page should be called with the token. detailed usage video is below.
